Dude, wait up!
#L1
???
#R1
Oh, it's you.
#L17
I've got some people I want you
to meet. We're on a mission.
#L17
This is Prozon, our master tactician.
#L15
Hi.
#L17
Metallino, our fastest switcher.
#L18
Hey.
#L17
Krone...
#L5
...
#L17
He doesn't talk much...
#L17
...and over-enthusiastic Raider.
#L9
LET'S GO LET'S GO!!!
#L17
We're planning to get out of the 
simulation.
We may have found a way, 
with the help of Mac and Max.
#L17
But we need all the help
we can get.

Do you want to join us?
#R1
I... I'm not sure...
This reality is all I know.
It's a tough decision.
#L17
Think about it.
I'll come find you again.
#R1
I will.

My name is Zac, by the way.
#L17
Awesome, your memory is
still improving!

You're gradually awakening.
#R1
I guess so...
#L17
See you, Zac.
#R1
Bye.
#R13
...
#R13
Nice little chat you had there.
#L1
!!!
#R13
Attempting to leave the simulation,
though likely impossible, is 
highly dangerous.
#R13
Not to mention it could jeopardize
our mission.
You need to understand that
this is for the good of everyone.
#L1
...
#R13
I see you are skeptical.
You must trust me.
I only want what is best for you.
#L1
Then tell me who you are.
#R13
...
#R13
I'm you.
#R13
Well, a digital version of you.
#L1
What?!!

How is that even possible?!
#R13
It's true.

Who better to help you than yourself?
#L1
...
#L1
Do the others also hear...
their digital copies?
#R13
No, I talk to all of them.
#L1
Why you, or me... then?
#R13
Because this was all your idea, Zac.
#L1
!!!
#R13
I know this is a lot to take in.

I will let you contemplate on the
idea for a while.
#R13
Until we meet again...
