#R13
Bravo, you did it once again!
#L01
What can you tell me about these
orbital cites?
#R13
Oh, some distant memory 
of yours I suppose.
#L01
Rayna said we used to live there?
#R13
!... Oh well, I suppose there's
no harm in telling you now.
These orbital cities were places
of scientific research.
#L01
Were? What happened to them?
#R13
We cannot be sure if they still exist,
but probably not.
As soon as the threat started to
take form, we fled.
#L01
The threat?
#R13
From artificial inteligence, of course.
Also known as AI.
The cities served as a precautionary
measure against it.
#R13
Being at a safe distance from
our home planet, each city was
able to evacuate their citizens.
#R13
While the threat doesn't catch up
to us, we must increase our own 
intelligence in order to prevail.
This is the purpose of the simulation.
#L01
This is getting confusing...
#R13
Yes, it is confusing!
Do not worry about it.

Just focus on the challenges ahead.
